      <h1 class="section-two__title"> About me </h1>
    <p class="section-two__desc">I’m an engineer turned business enthusiast with a strong foundation in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Along the way, I developed a keen interest in business and finance, which led me to pursue two master’s degrees—one in International Business from Singapore and another in Accounting and Business Finance with Data Analytics from the UK.I’ve also had the privilege of working at Accenture, where I managed financial processes across a global portfolio. This role gave me valuable experience in both strategy and execution within a major multinational environment. Beyond my technical and business expertise, I’ve been an active leader, serving as a delegate for the National Union of Students (NUS) and as a member of my university’s Scrutiny Committee, where I had the chance to influence key decisions and ensure smooth governance.Recently, I’ve developed a passion for coding and am diving into Full Stack Development to enhance my technical skills. I’m always eager to learn and stay engaged in new challenges, constantly looking for ways to combine my diverse skills in creative and impactful ways.</p>
